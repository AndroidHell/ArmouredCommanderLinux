HELP_TEXT = [
	('AP', """\
AP refers to an Armour-piercing gun shell. As the shell is designed to punch through armour,
it has a minimal explosive charge and thus will do no significant damage to infantry or AT
guns. Only Direct Fire mode can be used with this type of shell. Enemy tanks, SPGs, and AT
guns will always use AP fire against you and friendly armour.
"""),
	('HVAP', """\
High velocity Armour-piercing gun shell. Produced for the 76mm guns on American tank
destroyers, they consist of a dense tungsten carbine core surrounded by an aluminium casing. 
The shell was able to penetrate armour at much further ranges than the standard 76mm AP
shell. They were normally only issued to Tank Destroyers. Their use by M4 Sherman crews in
this and other simulations is not supported by historical evidence, but rather represents
a few shells 'appropriated' from supplies.
"""),
	('APDS', """\
Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot gun shell. A type of shell with a dense core surrounded by
pedal-shaped sabots that separate from the core in flight. Very effective against armour.
APDS rounds in British and Commonwealth forces were rare up to late 1944.
"""),
	('HE', """\
HE refers to a High-explosive gun shell. These shells are designed for use against lightly
or unarmoured vehicles, gun teams, and other infantry. Fully armoured vehicles will normally
only be damaged by HE in the case of a Critical Hit. HE can be fired in either Direct or Area
fire mode. En route to your starting location, you will use a random number of HE shells
suppressing infantry attacks.
"""),
	('WP', """\
WP refers to a White Phosphorus smoke-producing shell. WP burns quickly producing a blanket of
smoke. They are harmful to anyone nearby, and thus are only used against enemy positions. WP
must be fired in Area Fire mode. A successful hit with WP produces 1 Smoke Factor in the target's
hex and, if the target is in medium or long range, an additional Smoke Factor in each adjacent
hex in the same range band.
"""),
	('HCBI', """\
HCBI refers to a Hexachlorothane-Base Initiating smoke-producing shell. HCBI produces a great deal
of smoke, with the benefit of being safe to use near friendly forces. Only a limited number 
of HCBI shells are available each day: 10 on the first day, and 1-10 each day thereafter. HCBI
must be fired in Area Fire mode. A successful hit with HCBI produces 2 Smoke Factors in the target's
hex and, if the target is in medium or long range, additional Smoke Factors in each adjacent
hex in the same range band.
"""),
	('M4 Sherman', """\
A medium tank produced by the United States and in service from 1942 to 1955 in the American
armed forces. There were over a dozen variants of this tank produced, plus other vehicles that
were built on its chassis or hull. The original M4 was intended for infantry support and mobile
attack, and was vastly outclassed by most other medium and heavy German tanks in the later part
of the war.
"""),
	('Hidden', """\
Hidden units are enemy units that you know are in the area, but to which you do not have a direct
line of sight. Hidden units cannot be targeted by your tank, but nor can they initiate attacks
against you. Units remain hidden unit either they or you change their position; no spotting checks
can reveal them unless one of you moves.
"""),
	('Unspotted', """\
Unspotted units are enemy units that have been reported by friendly observers but which have not yet
been spotted by the crew of your tank. Unspotted units can attack you and friendly units, but you
cannot attack them until they are spotted.
"""),
	('Unidentified', """\
Unidentified units have been spotted by the crew of your tank, but you do not yet know what specific
type of tank, self-propelled gun, or AT gun they are until they are Identified. Unidentified units
attack and can be targeted as normal, but you do not know how powerful your enemy is until you
can successfully identify it.
"""),
	('Call Artillery', """\
Call Artillery is an action used on an adjacent enemy-controlled area in the campaign day map. If
successful, an artillery strike is called in on the map area. Whether or not the call is
successful, your battle group will move into the area after the strike attempt. The action
takes 15 mins. of time, plus the time required to enter the new area. The strike has a 70
percent chance of being called in.
"""),
	('Hull Down', """\
A vehicle that is Hull Down has its hull hidden behind something that will absorb incoming
fire, such as a hill or stone wall. Targets that are Hull Down are not affected by hits
that would normally affect the hull, and are thus much harder to hit effectively. If your
tank is Hull Down, you cannot fire the Hull MG. Hull Down is lost if your tank moves or
pivots, and must be regained via the appropriate order to the Driver.
"""),
	('Rate of Fire', """\
Rate of Fire (RoF) means that the Gunner and Loader have worked quickly enough to fire off
multiple shells at the same target in quick succession in the same turn. In order to maintain RoF,
you must
reload a shell into the main gun, and the shell must be compatible with the current target
type. So if you fire an AP shell in Direct Fire and reload a WP shell, you cannot maintain
RoF since WP must be fired in Area Fire mode. The Gunner's and Loader's skill both improve
the chance of maintaining RoF. If you are reloading from the Ready Rack then the chance is
greatly increased; otherwise, if the Assistant Driver is on Pass Ammo orders, then his
skill is instead applied as a positive modifier. You don't have to use the extra shot;
press [End] or [Space] instead to progress to the next phase.
"""),
	('VP', """\
VP refers to Victory Points. You are awarded VP for capturing areas on the campaign day map,
and for your tank destroying units during an Encounter. Your final VP indicates how
successful your campaign has been.
"""),
	('Armour', """\
All vehicles in the game are protected by some level of armour. When determining if a hit
on a unit destroys it or not, the armour value of the hit location is used to calculate
the odds of penetrating the armour and destroying the unit. Vehicles can have up to four
different armour values: one each for the turret front and sides, and one each for the hull
front and sides. Armour on the rear of the vehicle is always one level lower than the
side of the same location. Armour levels progress as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11,
14, 18, and 26.
"""),
	('Advance Mission', """\
In an Advance mission your task is to move through the map, capturing areas and destroying
any enemy resistance you encounter. If you can capture your exit area before nightfall you
will be awarded bonus Victory Points and will have the opportunity to continue advancing
into a new map zone.
"""),
	('Battle Mission', """\
In a Battle mission your task is to move through the map and capture enemy-controlled
areas, but the resistance you meet will be much stronger, better prepared, and better
fortified than in an Advance mission. Considering making full use of artillery and air
support, as well as advancing fire. Capturing your exit area awards you bonus VP as
normal.
"""),
	('Counterattack Mission', """\
A Counterattack is quite different from an Advance or Battle mission. Since the enemy is
advancing on you, you begin at the top of the map and the enemy comes to you. If your map
area is surrounded by enemy-controlled areas, your battlegroup must move to rejoin your
battle line. Once an encounter begins you always begin Stopped and Hull Down, and
have a chance to ambush the enemy and attack first. Victory Points are only awarded for
destroying enemy units.
"""),
	('Direct Fire', """\
In this firing mode you aim the shot directly at the enemy target. The to-hit roll is
affected by range, smoke, terrain, etc. modifiers. Must be used with AP, HVAP, and APDS;
may be used with HE; may not be used with WP and HCBI ammo.
"""),
	('Area Fire', """\
In this firing mode you aim the shot toward the general location of the enemy target. The
to-hit roll has no modifier for terrain, but any terrain modifier will be applied to any
subsequent to-kill roll. This makes it easier to hit with smoke rounds, and gives a greater
chance of pinning a target infantry unit with a close hit if a direct hit would be unlikely.
May be used with HE; may not be used with AP, HVAP, and APDS; must be used with WP and HCBI.
"""),
	('Skill Activations', """\
Crew skills are automatically tested for activation every time they have the possibility of
being activated. For example, a skill that affects firing with the main gun will be checked
every time the main gun is fired.
