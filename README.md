# Armoured Commander Linux Fork

## Reddit user /u/ArmouredCommander gets full credit as this is their game

I saw this on reddit and saw that it was done in python and since I am currently workng on the python RL tut, curiousity got hte better of me.

I simply jump through the terminal output rabbit hole and evenually got this runningo n Ubuntu 14.04. 

I included the files for libtcod until I get yelled at as the engine is in no way my own. 

The only thing you might need to do to get this running is to install pygame

Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install python-pygame"

Then make sure armcom.py is executagble and run it from terminal or double clicking.
