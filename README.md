# Armoured Commander Linux Fork

## Reddit user /u/ArmouredCommander gets full credit as this is their game

I saw this on reddit and saw that it was done in python and since I am currently workng on the python RL tut, curiousity got hte better of me.

I simply jumped through the terminal output rabbit hole and evenually got this running on Ubuntu 14.04. 

I included the files for libtcod until I get yelled at as the engine is in no way my own. 

The only thing you might need to do to get this running is to install pygame

Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install python-pygame"

Other distros: yum/pacman/whatever "python-pygame" probably :P

Then make sure armcom.py is executable and run it from terminal or double clicking.
